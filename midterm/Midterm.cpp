/*
You are given an array that contains N numbers. You want to determine if there are two numbers whose sum equals a given number K. For instance, if the input is 8, 4, 1, 6, and K is 10, then the answer is true (4 and 6), whereas for K = 11, the input is false. A number may be used twice.

Do the following:

a. Give an O(N^2) algorithm to solve the problem.

b. Give an O(N log N) algorithm to solve the problem.

c. Code your solution (the better one) in the form of the function indicated below. Also, write a test program to see if your code works. You are allowed to use any library from the STL.

bool hasNumber(vector<int>&, int K) {

}
/*
Write the pseudo code for the 2 solutions in comments. Please upload your file as <your_lastname>.cpp
